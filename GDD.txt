### **Second Wind - Game Design Document**

## **Game Overview**

**Genre:** Single-player Roguelike Boss Rush with Soulslike combat mechanics
**Core Loop:** Face increasingly challenging 1v1 arena battles, die, learn, upgrade, and try again
**Setting:** Abstract combat arenas focused on pure mechanical skill
**Platform:** PC

## **Core Design Philosophy**

Second Wind creates deep, complex gameplay from a small set of simple abilities. Every mechanic serves the core 1v1 combat experience, rewarding player observation, timing, and tactical execution over button mashing. Combat feels fast and responsive (Sifu/Sekiro) rather than weighty (Dark Souls).

## **Core Gameplay Loop**

1. Start a new run with a randomly assigned gamestyle
2. Fight through 5 increasingly difficult arena battles
3. Earn fragments from victories to purchase permanent upgrades
4. Stack temporary bonuses with each enemy defeated
5. Death returns you to the hub, keeping fragments and memories but losing all temporary bonuses
6. Use accumulated knowledge and upgrades to progress further

## **Combat System**

### **Basic Actions**

**Attack**
* Simple melee strike dealing base 5 damage
* Fast execution with animation-based cooldown
* Can be performed during counter windows for bonus effects

**Directional Block**
* Hold to enter blocking stance
* Move mouse horizontally to adjust block direction (left/center/right)
* Matching enemy attack direction reduces damage by 40%
* Successful blocks open 0.5-second counter windows
* Wrong direction leaves you vulnerable

**Strategic Dodge**
* Hold movement direction briefly, then press dodge button
* Three directions: left, right, back
* Creates distance and opens 1-second counter windows
* 0.5-second cooldown prevents spam

**Dash Attack**
* Forward dash to close distance
* Can combo into leap attack during dash
* Aggressive positioning tool

### **Special Ability: Hack**

A devastating ranged attack earned through skilled play:
* Requires 6 successful counter-attacks to charge
* Deals 50 damage at 1000 unit range
* Counter progress shown as filling indicators
* Resets if hit twice without blocking
* Rewards defensive mastery

### **Counter System**

Counter windows are brief opportunities after successful defensive actions:
* Appear after blocking or dodging attacks
* Allow attacks while maintaining defense
* Build toward hack ability
* Create risk/reward decisions

## **Health & Combat Flow**

### **Phase System**

Both player and enemies use a phase-based health system:
* Each phase = 100 health
* Depleting health triggers finisher state
* Opponent must execute finisher to progress phase
* Creates dramatic combat moments

**Player:** 2 phases (200 total health)
**Enemies:** 1-5 phases based on arena difficulty

### **Finisher Mechanics**

When a phase ends:
1. Victim enters vulnerable finisher state
2. Attacker must actively execute finisher
3. Successful finisher transitions to next phase or victory
4. Both combatants reset to neutral positions

## **Progression Systems**

### **Gamestyles (Temporary Run Bonuses)**

Each run randomly assigns one of five gamestyles that grows stronger with each victory:

**Defense:** Increases maximum health and provides healing with each kill
**Offense:** Adds flat damage to all attacks
**Mobility:** Reduces ability activation times for faster reactions
**Utility:** Extends counter window durations
**Technomancer:** Reduces hack requirements for more frequent use

These bonuses stack with each arena victory but reset on death, ensuring each run feels unique.

### **Memories (Permanent Upgrades)**

Spend fragments between arenas to unlock permanent improvements:

**Currently Implemented:**
* **Tactical Analysis (4 fragments):** Reveals enemy weak points for 1.5x damage + knockback
  * 3-second active periods with random side selection
  * 2-second cooldown after successful hit
  * Visual glow indicates vulnerable side

**Note:** Additional memories to be implemented (8-10 total planned for Phase 9)

Memories persist across all runs (within same game session), providing meta-progression.

### **Fragment Economy**

Fragments are the primary currency earned by defeating enemies:
* Reward scales with enemy phases defeated
* Early enemies: ~4 fragments
* Late enemies: ~30 fragments
* Balanced to encourage full arena completion

## **Arena Structure**

### **Level Design**

**Starting Hub (Zone 0)**
* Safe training area with practice dummy
* Respawn point after death
* No combat pressure

**Combat Arenas (Zones 1-5)**
* Five sequential 1v1 battles
* Increasing enemy phase count (1-5)
* Identical arena layouts, different opponents
* Focus on pure combat skill

**Safe Corridors**
* Connect combat zones
* Contain memory shop for upgrades
* Automatic full healing
* Brief respite between battles

### **Door System**

Doors control pacing and commitment:
* Entry doors require deliberate approach (2-second proximity)
* Exit doors lock during combat
* Victory unlocks progression
* No retreat once committed

## **Enemy Design**

### **Training Dummy**
* Always available in hub
* 2 phases for practice
* Respawns automatically
* Perfect for testing combos

### **Arena Enemies**
* Unique opponent per arena
* Phase count matches arena number
* Increasingly complex attack patterns
* Each teaches different combat lessons

## **Camera & Controls**

### **Camera System**
* Third-person perspective
* Automatic enemy lock-on (no manual toggle)
* Maintains combat focus
* Fixed pitch during combat
* Smooth follow during movement

### **Movement**
* Ground-based combat (no jumping)
* Strafe movement when locked on
* Position matters for dodging and spacing
* Walk speed balanced for tactical positioning

3. **Meaningful Progression:** Both temporary and permanent growth
4. **Replayability:** Gamestyle variety ensures unique runs
5. **Respect for Time:** Quick restarts, no padding
6. **Tactical Depth:** Simple inputs, complex decisions
