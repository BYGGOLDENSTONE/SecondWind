#### **1. Core Gameplay & Combat**

This is the heart of your game, and it's generally well-structured. The separation of concerns into different components (`CombatComponent`, `BlockingComponent`, `DodgeComponent`, `HealthComponent`) is a good design choice.

* **What's Good:**
    * **Component-Based Design:** The use of separate components for different functionalities (combat, health, blocking, etc.) is excellent. It promotes modularity and makes the code easier to manage and extend.
    * **Clear Input Handling:** The use of the Enhanced Input system in `ASecondWindCharacter` is modern and well-implemented.
    * **State-Driven Logic:** The code effectively uses boolean flags and timers to manage states like `bIsAttacking`, `bIsBlocking`, and `bInCounterWindow`.

* **Potential Issues & Suggestions:**
    * **Redundant `CanAttack` Logic:** In `ASecondWindCharacter::Attack`, you have this check: `if (BlockingComponent && !CombatComponent->CanAttack())`. The `CanAttack` function in `UCombatComponent` already checks if the player is blocking. You can simplify this by just calling `CombatComponent->PerformAttack()` and letting the component handle the logic.
    * **Hardcoded Values:** Many values, like damage, cooldowns, and ranges, are hardcoded in the C++ files. While you've used `EditDefaultsOnly`, consider exposing more of these as `UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere)` to allow for easier tweaking in the Unreal Editor.
    * **Direct Actor Searching:** In `UCameraLockOnComponent::FindBestTarget`, you use `UGameplayStatics::GetAllActorsOfClass` to find all `ATrainingDummy` and `AArenaEnemy` actors. This can be inefficient if there are many actors in the level. Consider using a more optimized method, like maintaining a list of active enemies in a manager class.

#### **2. Game Progression & Systems**

The `RunManager`, `FragmentSystem`, and `MemorySystem` form the backbone of your game's progression. They are generally well-implemented, but there are opportunities for improvement.

* **What's Good:**
    * **Subsystem Usage:** Using `UGameInstanceSubsystem` is the correct approach for systems that need to persist across level loads.
    * **Clear Separation:** The responsibilities of each system are well-defined: `RunManager` handles the game loop, `FragmentSystem` manages currency, and `MemorySystem` handles upgrades.

* **Potential Issues & Suggestions:**
    * **Memory Effects Application:** The `UMemorySystem::ApplyMemoryEffects` function is a good start, but it could be made more robust. As you add more memory types, this function could become large and complex. Consider using a more data-driven approach, perhaps with a base `UMemoryEffect` class that can be applied to the character.

#### **3. Level & Arena Management**

You have two different systems for managing the arenas: `ASimplifiedArenaSystem` and `ALevelLayoutManager`. It's important to decide on a single, unified approach.

* **What's Good:**
    * **`ALevelLayoutManager`:** This system is more robust and scalable. It discovers actors in the level and manages them, which is a great way to handle level design. This allows for more complex and varied arena layouts.
    * **`ASimplifiedArenaSystem`:** This system is good for prototyping and simple, procedurally generated layouts.

* **Potential Issues & Suggestions:**
    * **Conflicting Systems:** As mentioned, you have two arena management systems. I recommend committing to the `ALevelLayoutManager` system, as it's more flexible for level designers. You should remove the `ASimplifiedArenaSystem` to avoid confusion and potential conflicts.
    * **Actor Spawning:** In `ALevelLayoutManager`, you've commented out the auto-spawning of the training dummy, stating that it should be placed manually. This is a good design choice, as it gives level designers more control.

### **Summary & Next Steps**

Overall, your "SecondWind" project is off to a great start. The code is generally clean, well-organized, and follows good object-oriented principles. Here are my top recommendations for your next steps:

1.  **Unify Arena Management:** Choose between `ALevelLayoutManager` and `ASimplifiedArenaSystem` (I recommend the former) and remove the other to streamline your level management.
2.  **Implement Data Persistence:** Add saving and loading functionality to your `FragmentSystem` and `MemorySystem` so that player progress is not lost between sessions.
3.  **Continue Data-Driving Your Design:** Continue to expose variables to the Unreal Editor using `UPROPERTY()` so that you and your team can tweak gameplay values without needing to recompile the code.

You've built a solid foundation for a fun and engaging game. Keep up the great work!
